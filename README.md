# CSGOKnifeDataScraper
Used to scrape data from Steam Marketplace regarding Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) knives. 
Download SQLite3 to access the generated database and make sure the Selenium WebDriver is in the working directory 
and is the same version as Google Chrome installed on your computer. A sample database has been generated with knife data 
extracted from May 2020 under knives_sample.db.
